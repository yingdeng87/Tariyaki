						      I want you to know</br>
						      one thing.</br>

						      You know how this is:</br>
						      if I look</br>
						      at the crystal moon, at the red branch</br>
						      of the slow autumn at my window,</br>
						      if I touch</br>
						      near the fire</br>
						      the impalpable ash</br>
						      or the wrinkled body of the log,</br>
						      everything carries me to you,</br>
						      as if everything that exists,</br>
						      aromas, light, metals,</br>
						      were little boats</br>
						      that sail</br>
						      toward those isles of yours that wait for me.</br>

						      Well, now,</br>
						      if little by little you stop loving me</br>
						      I shall stop loving you little by little.</br>

						      If suddenly</br>
						      you forget me</br>
						      do not look for me,</br>
						      for I shall already have forgotten you.</br>
